			<h1>What Designer Can Do</h1>
			<h2>a mirror perspective on Graphic Design between Automation, Relativism, Élite and Cognitariat by Silvio Lorusso (2017)</h2>

			<p>This is a paragraph.After reading the article, I took a solid pause to process it and figure out not only how to start my response, but also whether I even wanted to copy-paste from the original. I prefer the hard mode, so let’s go with a summary that better shows what I actually understood from the text — and then it’s up to you to decide. Though I will start with the very same quote the author used:</p>
			<p>“The thing that pisses me off the most is the degradation of the intellectual role of the designer.”</p>
			<p>What a striking way to paint a deliberately raw picture of a profession losing its cultural weight. In What Design Can’t Do — Graphic Design between Automation, Relativism, Élite and Cognitariat, Lorusso does exactly that.</p>
			<p>He begins with the <span>gig economy</span>, where design appears side by side with everyday services. A logo for five dollars. A poster for nine. Websites squeezed in between Excel sheets. Platforms like Fiverr and TaskRabbit don’t elevate design — they flatten it, shrinking intellectual labor into a routine service.</p>
			<p><span>Automation</span> is another force in this story. Not the distant sci-fi fear of robots replacing humans, but the everyday reality of software defaults and online generators. Lorusso recalls Vonnegut’s Player Piano: once a movement is recorded, a machine repeats it endlessly. Opening Word or InDesign feels the same. The page isn’t blank at all — it’s already filled with invisible choices. Margins. Fonts. Grids. Someone else’s design before you even start.</p>
			<p>From here comes <span>template culture</span>. Why spend time on small decisions when the default can be celebrated for its efficiency? British designer Daniel Eatock once created a generic poster for any event. One poster fits all. He proved his own redundancy. The irony? The designer disappears.</p>
			<p>Lorusso also highlights <span>appropriation and visual relativism</span>. Postmodernism declared “no more rules”: Kraftwerk sleeves modeled on Constructivism, Peter Saville borrowing from Futurism, Tibor Kalman inspired by supermarket signs. High and low collapse into an endless carousel. </p>
			<p>Minimalist, maximalist, nostalgic, futuristic — pick your poison.</p>
			<p>Anything goes. </p>
			<p>(And when everything goes,)</p>
			<p>Nothing leads.</p>
