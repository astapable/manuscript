			<h1>What Designer Can Do</h1>
			<h2>A mirror perspective on Graphic Design between Automation, Relativism, Élite and Cognitariat by Silvio Lorusso (2017)</h2>

			<p>This is a paragraph.After reading the article, I took a solid pause to process it and figure out not only how to start my response, but also whether I even wanted to copy-paste from the original. I prefer the hard mode, so let’s go with a summary that better shows what I actually understood from the text — and then it’s up to you to decide. Though I will start with the very same quote the author used:</p>
			<title>“The thing that pisses me off the most is the degradation of the intellectual role of the designer.”</title>
			<p>What a striking way to paint a deliberately raw picture of a profession losing its cultural weight. In What Design Can’t Do — Graphic Design between Automation, Relativism, Élite and Cognitariat, Lorusso does exactly that.</p>
			<p>He begins with the <span>gig economy</span>, where design appears side by side with everyday services. A logo for five dollars. A poster for nine. Websites squeezed in between Excel sheets. Platforms like Fiverr and TaskRabbit don’t elevate design — they flatten it, shrinking intellectual labor into a routine service.</p>
			<p><span>Automation</span> is another force in this story. Not the distant sci-fi fear of robots replacing humans, but the everyday reality of software defaults and online generators. Lorusso recalls Vonnegut’s Player Piano: once a movement is recorded, a machine repeats it endlessly. Opening Word or InDesign feels the same. The page isn’t blank at all — it’s already filled with invisible choices. Margins. Fonts. Grids. Someone else’s design before you even start.</p>
			<p>From here comes <span>template culture</span>. Why spend time on small decisions when the default can be celebrated for its efficiency? British designer Daniel Eatock once created a generic poster for any event. One poster fits all. He proved his own redundancy. The irony? The designer disappears.</p>
			<p>Lorusso also highlights <span>appropriation and visual relativism</span>. Postmodernism declared “no more rules”: Kraftwerk sleeves modeled on Constructivism, Peter Saville borrowing from Futurism, Tibor Kalman inspired by supermarket signs. High and low collapse into an endless carousel. </p>
			<p>Minimalist, maximalist, nostalgic, futuristic — pick your poison.</p>
			<p>Anything goes. </p>
			<p>(And when everything goes,)</p>
			<p>Nothing leads.</p>
			<p>nothing leads. The “star designer” fades, their once singular voice drowned in a crowded digital marketplace.</p>
			<p>And when everything goes, nothing leads. The “star designer” fades, their once singular voice drowned in a crowded digital marketplace.</p>
			<p>Others move in the opposite direction, toward writing. The writer-designer intellectualizes practice, publishing essays and research first, sometimes outsourcing the visual outcome entirely. But this new role rarely leaves the design bubble — recognized only by other designers.</p>
			<p>At the same time, design seeps into everyday life in almost invisible ways. A new Facebook cover. A blog template swap. A PowerPoint tweak. Small chores, but Lorusso calls this <span>diluted design</span>. We are all “hyperemployed,” juggling countless small tasks that resemble design. In this world, graphic design risks being valued on the same level as sending an email.</p>
			<p>Even politics illustrates this shift. Bernie Sanders’ loose, “authentic” campaign visuals felt more powerful than Hillary Clinton’s flawless corporate branding. And Trump’s meme machine — chaotic, amateur, built with free tools — spread faster than any official campaign. While professionals debated kerning, memes captured the public imagination.</p>
			<p>Education doesn’t escape either. Students are urged to “make the world a better place,” running on coffee and competition, while ignoring their own precarious future. Critical design borrows from startup logic, promising to solve complex problems with shiny artifacts. The result is what Lorusso calls the <span>entreprecariat</span>: designers forced to be both entrepreneurs and precarious workers, hustling endlessly but rarely secure.</p>
			<p>His conclusion is bleak. Graphic design has shifted from creative craft to cognitive labor. The battle against free tools and unpaid work seems lost: in a world drowning in templates, why pay? Schools become “temporary autonomous élites,” selling students borrowed time before sending them back into uncertainty. At worst, design is reduced to a service micromanaged down to “two points left, two points right.”</p>
